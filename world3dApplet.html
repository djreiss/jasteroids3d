This is my test applet for the 3-D rendering routines that I have
written in Java, and implemented in my <a
href="JAsteroids.html">3-D JAsteroids</a> game. It allows selection of
various rendering methods, including Gourad (intensity-interpolated)
shading, image mapping, flat polygon shading, and wireframe drawing,
plus colored directional, point, and attenuated point light sources,
ambient, diffuse, and specular shading, and depth cueing.  Once I get
the Gourad and image-mapping routines to be a bit faster, I will start
to use them in <a href="JAsteroids.html">3-D JAsteroids</a>.  In the
meantime, enjoy...

Note this applet requires a Java 1.1 capable browser such as Netscape
Communicator 4.0 or higher, or IE 4.0 or higher to run.

<br>

Soon to come (hopefully)...faster rendering, bump-mapping, and
Phong (normal-interpolated) shading.
