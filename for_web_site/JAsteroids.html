Due to multiple requests, I've decided to allow you to decide what
version of the game best fits your computer. So just fill out the form
below and press "Start Game" to load the correct applet!<br><br>
Also, please enter your name to be recorded if you score a high score.<br>

(Nope, this doesn't work any more since GeoCities doesn't allow
CGI. Hopefully I'll figure out a way to do it...)  

<br><br><hr><br><a name=game>
<form method=GET action=JAsteroids_script.html>
Enter your name here: <input name="name" value="" size=20 maxlength=20> <== REQUIRED!
<table cellpadding=40><tr><td>
Enter the speed of your computer here:<br><br>
<input type="radio" name="speed" value="fast">Blindingly fast (233 MHz 
or faster)
<br>
<input type="radio" name="speed" value="normal" checked>Normal (120 
to 233 MHz)
<br>
<input type="radio" name="speed" value="slow">Pokey (slower than about 120 
MHz)
</td><td>
What size window would you like to play the game in?<br><br>
<input type="radio" name="size" value="large">Huge (800x600 pixels)
<br>
<input type="radio" name="size" value="normal" checked>Normal (650x500 pixels)
<br>
<input type="radio" name="size" value="small">Pitiful (500x400 pixels)
</td></tr></table>
<strong><INPUT TYPE="reset" VALUE="Reset to defaults"></strong>

This game should take about 20 to 30 seconds to download over a 33.6 kbaud modem if you have
Netscape (or IE) 4.0 or later. It will take twice that long for Netscape 3.0.

<font size=+2>NOTES:</font><br><br>

Note there is a bug in some browsers in which they aren't stopping the
animation when you move on to another page. This can freeze your
browser on some systems. To make sure this doesn't happen, press the
"Pause" button before you move to another page.

<br><br>

This is a 100% pure Java applet that is known to run well on Apple
Macs (both '040 and PPC), Sun Ultras running Solaris and Sparcs
running SunOS, and PCs running Linux, Win95, and Windows NT.  Not too
shabby, eh!?

<a name=instructions><center><u>Instructions</u>:</center><br>

You are the little white ship at the center of the cube. Use the
controls listed above to navigate in 3D-space and shoot the
asteroids. Use the radar (side and top) on the bottom right and the
ship's-eye view (bottom left) to help determine where you are.  Note
that when asteroids (and your ship) leave one side of the cube, they
return on the opposite side. Watch your energy...shields, thrusting
and firing uses up energy. Hitting an asteroid adds to your score
(smaller asteroids are worth more) and splits larger asteroids into
multiple smaller ones. When you destroy them all you move onto the
next round, which is harder. You get a total of 3 lives, but gain
additional lives when you score a multiple of 10000.  It's that
simple!

<br><br><hr><br><a name=whatsnew>
<center><u>New since version 1.0:</center></u><br>
<ul>

<li>High scores are now disabled because GeoCities won't allow
CGI. Anyone know of a way around this?

<li>Just fixed a bug that I didn't know about that was around since
July: high scores are once again being saved.

<li>NEW...A ship's-eye view to allow easier location of asteroids

<li>NEW...high scores! You have to end your game (or press the "End
Game" button) to see them, though.  

<li>Added those cute little flying saucers that fly through every once
in a while. The small pink ones move fast, shoot often, and are worth
more (2000 points). The larger, slower green ones are worth 1000
points. Beware, they shoot in your general direction and don't miss
very often!  Keep moving to make sure you don't get hit!  

<li>Nifty, more realistic animated explosions. (Note the bug that
sometimes they don't work the first time.  This is a limitation of
Java.)  

<li>Added some really poor sounds. More to come. Send me some better
ones if you've got 'em!  

<li>This page for customizing the game to your computer, and new code
that is more friendly for both very fast and very slow
computers. Looks really nice on a 300MHz Pentium II!  

<li>The rotating 3-D text at start-up that I am very proud of. It is
actually being rendered real-time!

</ul>
<br><a name=comingsoon>
<center><u>Coming soon</u> (hopefully):</center><br>
<ul>

<li>Better (but slower) graphics (with an option to turn them off for
slow computers)...  For a preview, look at my <a
href="world3dApplet.html">world3d applet</a>.

<br>

**Note you need a Java 1.1 compatible browser such as Netscape
Communicator 4.0 or later to run this applet.**

<li>Network play against (or in cooperation with) other players

<li>Getting around to fixing the bugs whereby sometimes more distant
objects get drawn after nearer objects

<li>Also fixing the drawing of the bounding cube in the ship's-eye
view

</ul>
